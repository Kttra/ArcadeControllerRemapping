# Hori Arcade Controller Remapper
 Remaps the controls for the hori arcade controller after physically changing the wiring to make it more suitable for future tone.

(1) Unscrew all the silver screws from the bottom of the controller.  
(2) Take a photo of the internal layout of the wires.  
(3) Pull on the black heatshrinked wires out one by one from all of the buttons. There are two attached to every button.  
(4) There are two clips on the left and right side of each button. Use a screwdriver to push those tabs on both sides inwards and the button will fall out of its socket.  
(5) With all the buttons pulled (except O and up arrow), flip the minicontroller over and start reinserting the buttons into the desired layout.  
(6) Rewire the buttons up as the originally were (remember that photo you took, right?).  
(7) Close the controller up and test that everything still works.  
(8) Now you need to reassign the buttons so they're pointed to the right location. Press and hold Assign (that's the far left button at the top) for 3 seconds until the light turns red.  
(9) Press and hold the button you want to assign for 3 seconds until the red assign light starts blinking.  
(10) Press and hold the button's original location for 3 seconds until the red light turns off.  
(11) Rinse and repeat steps (8) - (10) for all the buttons that were moved.
